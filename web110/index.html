       <p>Hello world, my name is Veronica Gable. I was born and raised in the rainy city of Seattle. I've been happily married for 5 years. Currently my husband and I don't have kids, nor plan on having them any time soon, but we do have two wonderful dogs, Charlie and Igor. One could say they are our "fur babies." </p>
       <p>In 2015, at 21 years of age, I joined the Army as a Petroleum Supply Specialist. Throughout my journey, not only did I learn hands on skills that were vital as a soldier, but it also taught me prized values, like loyalty, duty and respect. Because of the Army, I am now more confident, disciplined, and well rounded than before, not only when it's a question of taking orders, but in all aspects of life.  </p>
       <p>Now that I am no longer in the Military, I am focusing on my studies. I am currently enrolled in the SCC Web Design program where it's my second quarter. Back in the day, I would use HTML and CSS on my Myspace and Tumblr page layouts to make them stand out. It was something I throughly enjoyed doing, and now that I'm on a new path in life, I want to take that and make it into a successfull career.</p>
