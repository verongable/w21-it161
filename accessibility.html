<h2 class="subheader">Accessibility in Web Design</h2>

    <p>The understanding of user experience in the world of web design has become an increasingly prevalent concept. It has helped companies offer their users a more need-focused experience throughout their products and services. One of the most important topics that have emerged from this idea is accessibility. But what does accessibility even mean? According to W3C, the term means that “websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can: perceive, understand, navigate, interact with the Web and contribute to the Web.”  (Popescu) Being able to provide accessibility means being cognizant of these auditory, cognitive-motor, and neurological disabilities seen amongst individuals. According to Web AIM, an estimated 20% of the world’s population suffers from a disability. If a website isn’t accessible to everyone, it simply means that millions of people will be excluded from getting the information they need (Digital Design Standards).</p>
    
    <h3 class="subheader">Don't Get Fined</h3>
    <p>Apart from being inclusive, there are legal reasons that are important when designing an accessible website. Many countries have strengthened their disability laws, meaning if you don’t abide, you could get fined. Canada recently changed its laws, making it so that companies who don’t provide accessible websites have to pay a daily fine of up to $100,000, with company directors also being. No one is interested in taking that kind of financial hit, so designing an accessible website makes perfect sense.</p>
    
    <h3 class="subheader">Implement Tools</h3>
    <p>So how exactly do we improve accessibility for different impairments? We can start off by paying attention to those with sensory disabilities. For users that have hearing impairments, we can implement tools like text transcripts and video captioning. Not only are these useful for the deaf but also for those who don’t have disabilities. An accessibility study conducted by Ofcom discovered that 80% of those who use close captions are neither deaf nor hard of hearing (Geley). This goes to show how valuable these tools are for the total population.</p>

    <p>Accessibility doesn’t stop just by helping those who can’t see or hear. There are many other permanent and temporary disabilities that result in various challenges a user might encounter, all requiring unique solutions. In order to ensure a better experience for all users, follow the guidelines that have been established by the WC3. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provides a shared standard that adheres to web content accessibility. Whether you are a developer, designer, or accessibility expert, the documents provided help guide you in making your website more user-friendly by categorizing the topic into four different principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust (Geley). So implementing these standards can make a tremendous impact on your website by making it more accessible to those with or without impairments. </p>
